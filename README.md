1. Fixed Dynamic Arrays
In C++, a fixed dynamic array is declared with a constant size known at compile time. For example, int arr[5];. The array is created on the stack and its size cannot change during execution.

In Python, we create a fixed-size list like arr = [0] * 5. Even though it looks fixed, Python's list is actually placed on the heap, and internally it can be resized easily because lists are dynamic by nature.

Comparison:

In C++, the size is truly fixed, fast, and stack-allocated.

In Python, even though you make a list with a fixed number of elements, the system allows it to grow and shrink because the list is managed on the heap.

2. Stack Dynamic Arrays
In C++, stack dynamic arrays allow the size to be decided during execution, such as taking input from the user. Example: int arr[size];. This size is decided at runtime, but the array is still stored on the stack (only if the compiler allows VLAs).

In Python, you create the list based on user input like arr = [0] * size. However, the memory for lists in Python is always on the heap — Python does not have stack-based arrays for normal programming.

Comparison:

In C++, stack dynamic arrays are faster but risky because they can overflow the stack if they are too large.

In Python, there’s no stack overflow from lists because the heap memory grows as needed.

3. Fixed Heap Dynamic Arrays
In C++, fixed heap dynamic arrays are made using new, like int* arr = new int[5];. The array is on the heap, has a fixed size after allocation, and you must manually free it with delete[].

In Python, if you want a truly fixed array on the heap (not a normal list), you can use ctypes, such as ArrayType = ctypes.c_int * 5 and then create arr = ArrayType(). This acts like a C-style array in Python.

Comparison:

In C++, you have full manual control but must be careful to free memory to avoid leaks.

In Python, memory management is automatic; the garbage collector will free it eventually.

4. Heap Dynamic Arrays
In C++, heap dynamic arrays are created when both size and contents can change dynamically, but C++ arrays themselves do not grow automatically. You need to manually manage growth, or you can use classes like std::vector that handle resizing.

In Python, all lists are dynamic by default. You can start with any size and easily append, insert, or remove elements.

Comparison:

In C++, true dynamic resizing requires extra work unless you use vector.

In Python, dynamic resizing is simple and built-in.

Final Understanding
C++ gives you strict and powerful control over how memory is allocated — you can choose stack or heap, you must handle allocation and deallocation. Mistakes can cause crashes (memory leaks, corruption).

Python hides all memory management from the programmer — arrays (lists) live on the heap, grow automatically, and memory is cleaned up automatically when it is no longer used. This makes Python easier but slightly slower and less predictable in terms of memory performance.
